# PowerShell-Scripts
This shall be my storage of all of those strange powershell scripts I've ever created either for work or for personal use... but before that I need to gather them all from god knows where. No warranties.

Maybe some of these are originally yours and I've maybe just refactored or repurposed them for my needs. I promise to leave credits in files if possible. But yeah, designing a wheel hundreds of times again loses it's magic over the years... :)

You're welcome to use these as you wish and you're also free to contribute.
Oh.. about that use, you probably should keep credits if those are not mine.

Something about my way of scripting. I rather keep it simple (KISS anyone?) than create a mega wrapper for a script. I expect you to be able to read my scripts and suit it for yourselves. I'll try to add some descriptions in files.
